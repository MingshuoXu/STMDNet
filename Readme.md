**STMDNet**: A Lightweight Directional Framework for Motion Pattern Recognition of Tiny Target
========

## Introduction

This repository is an official implementation of the <STMDNet: A Lightweight Directional Framework for Motion Pattern Recognition of Tiny Target>. The full work is under review for publication, and therefore only selected components are made available at this time.

## Current Status
The project is in the pre-publication phase. Some code and data have been omitted to comply with submission guidelines and ensure the integrity of the review process.

## Pioneer Program

To explore the capabilities of STMDNet and STMDNet-F, you can download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MingshuoXu/Small-Target-Motion-Detectors). After downloading, you can run `start_by_matlab.m` using MATLAB or `start_by_python.py` using Python to get started.

## Repository Contents
- **`out_in_RIST/`**: Final result in the RIST dataset/
- **`evaluate_STMD_in_RIST/`**: Experience code for STMD-based models tesed in RIST.
- **`evaluate_comparison_model_in_RIST/`**: Experience code for machine learning model and deeplearning model tesed in RIST.
- **`groundtruth/`**: Some groundtruth in the synthetic datasets
- **`effective_of_direction/`**:

## Limitations
- The full implementation, including parameter configurations and complete data processing pipelines, will be released after the publication of the related article.
- Some comments and detailed documentation may also be added in future updates.


## Future Plans
- Release the full codebase upon acceptance and publication of the article.
- Provide detailed documentation and extended examples.
